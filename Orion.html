            <p>Orion is one of the most recognizable constellations. It is the brightest in the winter from November to February. The 3 stars of Orion’s belt are the most prominent in the constellation. The constellation is named after the hunter Orion. The myth of Orion begins with Orion proclaiming himself to be the best hunter in the world. This upsets Hera, the wife of Zeus. She sends a scorpion to kill him, and Zeus put Orion’s body into the sky.
