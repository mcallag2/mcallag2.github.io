            <p> The Ursa Major constellation appears in the northern sky and is the third largest constellation. Its brightest stars form the Big Dipper, and its name means ‘the greater bear’.  The myth associated with it is the story of a water nymph named Callisto who had sworn a vow of chastity. She broke the vow and had two sons with Zeus, but she was caught and turned into a bear as punishment. She lived in the woods for the next 15 years until she accidently ran into her long lost son. But, the son, Arcas, didn’t recognize her and tried to kill her. Zeus saw this and to prevent their deaths cast them both into the sky to be stars.
